# Simple RaspberryPi Fan Controller
A simple Raspberry Fan Controller written in RUST

It turns on the fan when the Raspberry Pi reaches 65 C and turns off when it reaches 50 C.

The temperature is measured using the Linux command: 
**/opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp** and filtering it using **egrep "[0-9.]{4,}" -o**:

**/opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp | egrep "[0-9.]{4,}" -o** 

It turns on and off the fan using a GPIO pin (number 21). 

This GPIO pin is connected to a circuit which uses the 5V Raspberry pin to power the fan. The circuit is shown below:

The extra resistor in the photo below is not necessary and was later removed.

Make sure the program runs on startup by including it in the /etc/rc.local script.
